# Guard::Brakeman [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/guard/guard-brakeman.png)](http://travis-ci.org/oreoshake/guard-brakeman)

Guard::Brakeman allows you to automatically run [Brakeman](http://brakemanscanner.org/) tests when files are modified.

Use guard-brakeman >= 0.4.0 for brakeman >= 1.5.3
--------------
And use < 0.4.0 for brakeman < 1.5.3

## Install

The simplest way to install Guard is to use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/).
Please make sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continue.

Add Guard::Brakeman to your `Gemfile`:

```bash
group :development do
  gem 'guard-brakeman'
end
```

Add the default Guard::Brakeman template to your `Guardfile` by running:

```bash
$ guard init brakeman
```

## Use sublime Text 2?

Check out [sublime_guard](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard)!  It gives you control Guard without leaving the editor.  This is even more powerful with Growl notifications.  Enter distraction-free mode and never leave!

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

Guard::Brakeman can be adapted to all kind of projects and comes with a default template that looks like this:

```ruby
guard 'brakeman' do
  watch(%r{^app/.+\.(erb|haml|rhtml|rb)$})
  watch(%r{^config/.+\.rb$})
  watch(%r{^lib/.+\.rb$})
  watch('Gemfile')
end
```

Please read the [Guard documentation](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.
